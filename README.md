# retro-game

This is a 2d game made in C++ and SFML with a kind of retro aesthetic.

## Description

The player controls a hero, that fights monsters in a procedurally generated world.



Enemies can spawn in different biomes.

All enemies have their own properties. Some will attack on sight, others will run away or be neutral.
There are also different monster types with their own properties. 

A few monsters will fight until their last hp point, while some others are going to escape if low on hp.

There are numerous classes to choose from and each has unique abilities.
